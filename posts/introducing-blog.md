# About Me
Hey, I'm Adlai, a Rotherham born and bred events and portraiture photographer who loves to capture every moment and the authentic story behind them.​

I've had the chance to work with people like the Children's Capital of Culture (in Rotherham), the Creative Lives charity,  the Retina UK/Worksop's Got Talent Team and the amazing ISU European Figure Skating Championships in Sheffield!​

Alongside, professional photography, you'll find me working on nature and wildlife photography and projects, which is a hobby that personally inspires me about the good and bad side of things.

​As well as my creative work, I am currently studying on a Level 3 Extended Diploma in Creative Media Production and Technology in Photography at Rotherham College to build on my technical skills.

# What to Expect
In the coming months, I'll be posting about:
• Skills: An introduction to photography including, the Exposure Triangle, Composition and using Mobile Phones or Professional Cameras (such as a DSLR or Mirrorless)
• Behind the Scenes: A look into the projects I am or have been doing.
• Much More: Anything I think will make good content, I'll try and post.

Thanks for taking your time to read, and I hope to see you again!
Adlai :)
