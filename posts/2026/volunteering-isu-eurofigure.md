## excerpt: Read about my time volunteering for the ISU Figure Skating European Champions, Sheffield 2026...

A couple of weeks ago, I had the amazing opportunity to volunteer at the ISU European Figure Skating Championships, held in Sheffield across both the Utilita Arena and Ice Sheffield.

Although I wasn’t photographing this time, I was part of the **Photographer Assistance Team**, supporting accredited photographers throughout the event. My role involved escorting photographers to their rink-side positions, keeping an eye on equipment during breaks, and generally being on hand wherever help was needed.

It was a brilliant chance to experience a major international sporting event from behind the scenes and to see first hand how sports photography operates in such a fast-paced, high-pressure environment.

Below are a few photos from this spectacular event (courtesy of ISU, © International Skating Union):
